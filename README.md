# DHT Sensor Driver for STM32
This is a library/driver for the DHT temperature and humidity sensor (AM2302) for the STM32. The library makes use of STM32's HAL definitions, and therefore should be fairly portable between platforms within their line of products. This library also makes use of a function defined is "Delay.h" to attain delay in micro seconds.
